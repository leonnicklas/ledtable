# LED Table

This repo holds the current code running on my LED-table seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYL9GYsOQjo).

> ⚠️ the code is no production code and may contain bugs. You are welcome to fork and commit pull requests.

## Get started

### Arduino libraries

Copy all libraries into your local arduino libraries folder and restart your arrduino IDE.

> ⚠️ NOTE this repository eventually does not have the latest version of all libraries anymore.

### Sketches

Download the sketch named `ledtisch.ino`, open it and verify it for any compilation errors. If everything is working fine upload it to your Arduino Due or similar and ENJOY 🙂
